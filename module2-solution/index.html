	<section ><p id="p1">Chicken</p>
		You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies,You may tread me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise.
		Does my sassiness upset you?Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room
	</section></div>
	<div class="col_lg_4 col_md_6 col_sm_12 "><section ><p id="p2">Beef</p>	
		Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I'll rise.
		Did you want to see me broken?Bowed head and lowered eyes?Shoulders falling down like teardrops.Weakened by my soulful cries.
	</section></div>
	<div class="col_lg_4 col_md_6 col_sm_12 x1"><section ><p id="p3">Shushi</p>
		Does my haughtiness offend you?Don't you take it awful hard' Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own back yard.
		You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I'll rise
